        <p>My name is Kyle Apsey.  I'm 30 years old, I work at New Order Coffee, and I've been living in Seoul, Korea for the past 5 years...I may also make weird faces when people take my picture.  Since I returned to Detroit, in March 2017, I have been looking forward to expanding my opportunities and most importantly, build my skills in a career that will enable me to live the life that I want for myself.</p>
